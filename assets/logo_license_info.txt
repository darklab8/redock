Galan Pang Mobile Repulsor Docking Clamps
"Quick pit stops require the ship to remain absolutely stationary. We've partnered with Galan Pang to get the best RDCs on the market. The extreme mobility and strength of these units allows us to have the ship locked in position within milliseconds of it arriving, ready for a quick change of the McKie shielding and Foss converter!"

-- Benny Raceship, director of Octan Energy Racing Team.

Based off artwork by Galan Pang. There'll be 4 that keep the ship levitated above the landing pad. I'm going to need a lot more of those black hoses!
